        <h3>
          An aspiring <span>Broadcaster</span>
        </h3>
        <p> I’m 𝙈𝙘 𝙑𝙞𝙣𝙯𝙮𝙣𝙩𝙝 𝙇𝙤𝙥𝙚𝙯, a first-year broadcasting student with a love for storytelling and a fascination with how media shapes our world. But my journey didn’t start in front of a microphone or behind a camera. In fact, it began long before I ever knew broadcasting would become my career. Growing up, I was always captivated by how stories, no matter how big or small, had the power to connect people. Today, I’m taking that passion to the next level in the world of broadcasting. This portfolio is a visual representation of my journey, both the experiences that led me here and the exciting path I’m now walking.</p>

        <p>I’m 𝙈𝙘 𝙑𝙞𝙣𝙯𝙮𝙣𝙩𝙝 𝙇𝙤𝙥𝙚𝙯, and my story starts in a small town where creativity thrived in the most unexpected places - Igbaras. Before broadcasting became my focus, I was a kid who didn’t know what ambition to hold and what dream to make, clueless how to create my own world. But then I found myself fascinated by documentaries and films. The idea that a single story could shape someone's perspective or change the way we perceive the world around us blew my mind. But it wasn’t until I started to join radio broadcasting contest that I realized broadcasting was where I truly belonged. I had found my voice, and I knew it was time to share it with the world. Now, as I take my first steps into the doors of broadcasting, I’m ready to bring my unique perspective and passion to the field.</p>

          <h3>Video Editing</h3>
          <p>During the 𝑳𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒈𝒐 𝒏𝒈 𝑲𝒂𝒃𝒂𝒕𝒂𝒂𝒏 2024, I had the privilege of participating in a Promotional Video-making contest, where together with a collaborative team, we captured and showcased the vibrant beauty of our barangay, Brgy. Jovellar. This project, which I directed, videographed, and edited, proudly earned 1st place, marking a significant milestone in my journey.</p>

              <h3>Photography</h3>
              <p>I am also a photographer, a storyteller through the lens of my camera. Photography is more than just a profession for me; it’s a passion that allows me to freeze fleeting moments and transform them into timeless memories. With every shot I take, I capture the raw emotions, the beauty of the world around me, and the stories that words alone can’t convey. </p>

              <h3>Layouting</h3>
              <p>I am also a layout artist, someone who brings ideas to life through design. To me, layouting is about more than just arranging text and images; it’s about creating a visual flow that captures attention and tells a story. Each project is a chance to craft something that not only looks appealing but also feels meaningful. </p>
